 ### UMD Eruv Webpage
 Most of the information on the history of the Eruv page can be found on the [site itself](/eruv_history.html). This
 isn't a very fancy project.

 #### Frequently Asked Questions:
 **Who are you?**
 I'm Yair Kosowsky-Sachs, student at UMD and general Eruv admirer.
 
 **Why do this?**
 No good reason. Mostly because I was bored during and after finals.
 
 **Why not use Wordpress, Wix, or some actual professional layout tool?**
 I was having fun learning the intricacies of CSS. Also, I'm a big believer in not overloading pages with [unnecessary web bloat](https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm).
 
 **Will you build my website/app/computer/social media site?**
 Oh, hey, would you look at the time.
