        <h2>University of Maryland Eruv</h2>
      <p>
        The University of Maryland Eruv surrounds the entire campus as well as some housing off campus,
        encompassing Hillel, Chabad, and much of College Park. The Eruv was founded in the early 2000s and has
        been going strong ever since.

        <p>
            The Eruv is currently maintained by Gavriel Epstein, '20. He and his brave crew daringly face the streets
            and telephone poles of College Park in order to make sure that the community is able to carry over the coming
            Shabbat.
        </p>
        <p>
            The UMD Eruv is checked every Friday morning and any needed maintenance is taken care of. After the check is
            complete, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eruvmaryland">UMD Eruv Facebook page</a> posts that the
            Eruv is up.

            The Eruv Committee is always looking for volunteers to check drivers to drive. If you are interested in
            helping out the community, please contact <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gavriel.epstein.9">Gavriel
            Epstein</a> on Facebook.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't know how to check? Don't know how to drive? We'd love to teach you! (At least, we can teach you the
            checking part; for driving you'll want <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShepherdsDrivingSchool/">someone
            else's</a> help.) The Eruv Committee checks each week, and repairs are often needed.  Joining the Eruv
            committee is a great way to give back to the community in a way that is extremely underappreciated
            considering the community's dependence on the Eruv.
